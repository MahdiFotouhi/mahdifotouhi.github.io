Currently, I'm looking for a Ph.D. studentship position in Cyber Security. I'm interested in research about IoT Security, Privacy, Software and system Security, Ethical Hacking, Social Media, and Machine learning. If you are aware of any opening or you know a professor who works close to my favorite subjects please contact me.
